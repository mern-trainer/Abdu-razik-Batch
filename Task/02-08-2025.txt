1. Implement a Fibonacci sequence calculator using memoization to optimize performance by caching previously calculated values.

2. Create a factorial calculator with memoization to store and reuse previously computed factorial results.

3. Develop a function that efficiently calculates and caches the sum of digits in a number using memoization.

4. Implement a function to calculate the cumulative sum of integers from 1 to a given number n using an optimized algorithm.

5. Create a function that efficiently calculates the sum of even numbers in a range from 1 to n.

6. Build an API integration function that:
   - Fetches random user data from https://dummyjson.com/users/{user_id} API
   - Generates random user IDs between 1-30
   - Handles API responses and potential errors
   - Returns formatted user information

7. Develop a Simple Interest Calculator that:
   - Takes principal amount, rate of interest, and time period as inputs
   - Validates input parameters
   - Returns calculated simple interest with proper formatting

8. Design and implement a Calculator Application with:
   - User Interface featuring a standard calculator layout
   - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
   - Result memoization to cache frequently used calculations
   - Error handling for invalid operations
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
